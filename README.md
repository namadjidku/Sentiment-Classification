### Sentiment Analysis
With the rise of online social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, and the proliferation of customer reviews on sites like Amazon and Yelp, we now have access, more than ever before, to massive text-based data sets! They can be analyzed in order to determine how large portions of the population feel about certain products, events, etc. This sort of analysis is called sentiment analysis. In this notebook an end-to-end sentiment classification system is build from scratch.

The used dataset is usually referredas the IMDb dataset. It consists of movie reviews from the website imdb.com, each labeled as either 'positive', if the reviewer enjoyed the film, or 'negative' otherwise.
